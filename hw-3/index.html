      <h1>Why freelancing is the future</h1>

      <p>
        Freelance work has become a popular career choice for a lot of people
        these days. Instead of working on a regular basis for one employer,
        freelancers are self-employed and offer their services to businesses,
        usually working with multiple clients at a time. Popular fields for
        freelance work include writing, design, marketing, and social media.
