            One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found
            himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his
            armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see
            his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff
            sections.

        <h2>Who & Why</h2>
        <p>
          The gentlemen who rented the room would sometimes take their evening
          meal at home in the living room that was used by everyone, and so the
          door to this room was often kept closed in the evening. But Gregor
          found it easy to give up having the door open, he had, after all,
          often failed to make use of it when it was open and, without the
          family having noticed it, lain in his room in its darkest corner. One
          time, though, the charwoman left the door.
